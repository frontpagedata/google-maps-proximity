```{r}

# setup
library(tidyverse) # makes life easier
library(googlesheets4) # R interface to Google Sheets (to read study plan)
library(googledrive) # to download all .csv
library(here)
library(geodist) # Compute distance between 2 coordinates

```

## Extracting the data

We download the data locally because it is not too large and it is good to have the data save somewhere else that only on the Google Drive.  

```{r}

# read the study plan:
study_plan <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KCDf10VUDOEMKvIobbgmAJub0w1ETslf4oVmrzS8wQQ/edit#gid=0"
)
rio::export(study_plan, "../raw_data/study_plan.csv")

```

```{r}

# read all the csv on the Drive and save them locally

n_sheets_to_download = dim(study_plan)[1]
previous_city = "init" # used to count number of sample by city
for (i in 1:n_sheets_to_download){
  current_sheet_link = study_plan[i,]$Link
  # print(current_sheet_link)
  
  # some info to rename the downloaded sample:
  current_city = stringr::str_replace_all(study_plan[i,]$City, " ", "-" ) # add city in filename
  # we could also add the law firm, but probably not useful. 
  # We add a sample number by city:
  if (previous_city == current_city){
    n_sample = n_sample + 1
  } else {
    n_sample = 1
  }
  # consistent name, for better ordering:
  padded_n_sample = stringr::str_pad(as.character(n_sample), 2, side = "left", pad = "0") 
  print(paste(current_city, padded_n_sample)) # where we are.
  
  # download the .csv locally:
  drive_download(
    file = current_sheet_link, 
    path = here::here("raw_data/raw_scans",
                      glue::glue("{current_city}_{padded_n_sample}.csv")),
    overwrite = TRUE
    )
  
  previous_city = current_city # re-initialize sample counter
}


```


## Reshape Data

We read all the .csv of the scans/samples, compute the distance to the center, and store everything in long format in a single tidy tibble.  


```{r}

all_files <- list.files(path = here::here("raw_data/raw_scans"))
counter = 1
all_samples_list = list()
for (file in all_files){
  sample_name = stringr::str_extract(file, '.*(?=\\.csv)')
  print(sample_name)
  # read sheet
  sample = rio::import(
    here::here("raw_data/raw_scans", glue::glue("{sample_name}.csv")),
    fill = TRUE, # avoid error with LA sample 12, fill empty col with NAs
    format = "csv",
    skip = 9) %>% # skip the first useless rows
    select(`Your Rank`, Latitude, Longitude) # select only the columns we need
  
  origin_lat = sample[113,]$Latitude
  origin_lon = sample[113,]$Longitude
  origin_rank = case_when(
    sample[113,]$`Your Rank` == "20+" ~ 21,
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(as.character(sample[113,]$`Your Rank`))
  )
  # print(origin_rank)
  sample <- sample %>% 
    mutate(
      geodist = as.numeric(round(geodist::geodist_vec(Latitude, Longitude, origin_lat, origin_lon)/1000, 4)), # /1000 for km
      rank = case_when(
        `Your Rank` == "20+" ~ 21,
        TRUE ~ as.numeric(as.character(`Your Rank`))
      ),
      city_sample = sample_name
    ) %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(drop = rank - origin_rank) %>% # drop to the origin rank
    ungroup() %>%
    select(city_sample, drop, geodist, rank, Latitude, Longitude)
  print(paste("origin: ", origin_rank, " , rank: ", sample[113,]$rank, ", drop: ", sample[113,]$drop))
  
  all_samples_list[[counter]] <- sample
  counter = counter + 1
  
}

# we have all the samples in a list, now we need to combine them in a single tibble:
# (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29402528/append-data-frames-together-in-a-for-loop/29419402)
all_samples = do.call(rbind, all_samples_list) %>%
  separate(city_sample, into = c("City", "Sample"), sep = "_")

# we save a tidy tibble in long format with all the samples for the scans
# it should contain all what we need for the analyses.
# rio::export(all_samples, "../proc_data/samples_10_10.csv")
# rio::export(all_samples, "../proc_data/samples_10_10.rds")
rio::export(all_samples, here::here("proc_data", "samples_50cities.csv"))
rio::export(all_samples, here::here("proc_data", "samples_50cities.rds"))
